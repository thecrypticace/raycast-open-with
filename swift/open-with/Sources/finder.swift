    // On my M3 Max it's about ~2.4s to process 500 items and this number can vary a good bit

    // Even in raw AppleScript you have to get the selection as an alias list or as text for it to not be slow
    // Need to use apple events here instead but sendEvent:id:code isn't available to Swift
    // Which means dropping ScriptingBridge entirely
    //
    // The relevant event IDs are
    // - `sele` (`0x73656C65`): gets the current selected finder items
    // - `alst` (`0x616C7374`): casts a selection to an alias list
    // - `pURL` (`0x7055524C`): gets the url for a given item (may or may not be relevant for alias lists â€” i have no idea)
