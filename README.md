# Open Finder Selection

This extension adds a command to Raycast called "Open Selected File With" that can be used to take the currently selected file from the Finder, show a filterable list of applications to open that file, and of course let you use that app to open it.

I'd recommend assigning this to a hotkey (e.g. `Command` + `Option` + `\`) for optimal use.
